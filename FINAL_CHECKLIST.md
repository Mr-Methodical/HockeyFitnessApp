## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Resolve Build Issue (Priority 1)
The EAS build is still failing. Here's your action plan:

**Option A: Use Your Actual Firebase Credentials**
```bash
# Update eas.json with your real Firebase config
# Replace the example values in eas.json "env" section with:
{
  "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key",
  "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN": "your_project.firebaseapp.com",
  "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID": "your_actual_project_id",
  "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET": "your_project.firebasestorage.app",
  "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID": "your_sender_id",
  "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID": "your_app_id"
}
```

**Option B: Use EAS Secrets (Recommended)**
```bash
# Set environment variables in EAS dashboard instead of eas.json
npx eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY --value "your_key"
npx eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN --value "your_domain"
# Continue for all Firebase variables...
```

**Option C: Alternative Build Method**
```bash
# Try local build first to verify configuration
npx expo run:android --variant release
# If that works, the EAS build should work too
```

### Step 2: Create Visual Assets (Priority 2)
You need these for Play Store submission:

**Feature Graphic (1024x500 pixels)**
- Create hockey-themed promotional image
- Use Canva, Figma, or any design tool
- Include app logo and hockey elements
- Save as `assets/feature-graphic.png`

**Screenshots (2-8 required)**
- Launch your app with `npx expo start`
- Navigate to key screens and take screenshots
- Capture: Coach Dashboard, Player Dashboard, Workout Logging, Leaderboard, AI Workouts, Team Messages, Achievements, Settings
- Save in `assets/screenshots/` folder

### Step 3: Set Up Google Play Console
1. **Register Developer Account** ($25 one-time fee)
   - Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
   - Complete developer profile
   - Verify identity (24-48 hours)

2. **Host Privacy Policy**
   - Upload `privacy-policy.md` to a website
   - Use GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, or any web host
   - You'll need the public URL for Play Console

## üöÄ BUILD TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Build Continues to Fail:

**Check Build Logs**
- Visit: https://expo.dev/accounts/ryanhowe07/projects/hockey-accountability-app/builds/
- Look for specific error messages in the "Bundle JavaScript" phase
- Common issues: environment variables, circular dependencies, syntax errors

**Alternative Solutions**:
1. **Simplify Build Profile** (temporary workaround):
   ```json
   // In eas.json, temporarily use:
   "production": {
     "android": {
       "buildType": "apk"  // Instead of app-bundle
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Clear Everything and Retry**:
   ```bash
   npx eas build --platform android --profile production --clear-cache
   ```

3. **Local Development Build**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-dev-client
   npx eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```
