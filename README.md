# HockeyFitnessApp
Ri\/aL is a mobile app for hockey teams and groups to stay in shape and connected during the offseason. Players log workouts, coaches track progress, and teams compete on leaderboards to stay accountable and motivated. Groups of motivated teammates can also join without a coach to create their own accountability channels.
