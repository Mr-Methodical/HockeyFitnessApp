EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Test the Feature
1. Restart your app: `npm start`
2. Log in as a player
3. Tap the "AI Trainer" tab

## üö® Important Notes:

### API Key Security:
- Keep your OpenAI API key secure
- Don't commit the `.env` file to git
- Monitor your OpenAI usage and costs
- Consider rate limiting for production use

### Cost Considerations:
- Each workout generation costs ~$0.002-0.01
- GPT-3.5-turbo is cost-effective for this use case
- Fallback workouts prevent failures
- Consider caching popular workout types

### Fallback System:
- If OpenAI API fails, shows basic hockey workout
- All core functionality works without AI
- Error handling prevents app crashes
- Users can still complete and log workouts

## üîÑ Future Enhancements:

### Possible Improvements:
1. **Workout History Analysis** - AI learns from user preferences
2. **Skill-Specific Training** - Target weak areas based on performance
3. **Team Workout Plans** - Coach can generate team-wide AI workouts
4. **Progress Adaptation** - Workouts get harder as player improves
5. **Injury Prevention** - AI considers player's injury history

### Additional Features:
- Voice commands during workouts
- Video demonstrations for exercises
- Real-time form feedback
- Integration with wearable devices

## Testing Instructions:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (FIXED)
```bash
npm install expo-notifications expo-device
```

### Step 2: Run Your App
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Push Notifications
1. **Log in to your coach account**
2. **You'll see a blue debug panel at the top of the dashboard**
3. **Tap "Quick Test"** - this will test if notifications work
4. **If that fails, tap "Full Diagnostic"** for detailed troubleshooting

### Step 4: Test Real Messages
1. **Create a player account** (or use existing)
2. **From coach dashboard, go to Messages ‚Üí New Message**
3. **Send a message to a player**
4. **Check if the player device receives a notification**

### Step 5: Check Logs
- Look at the console for detailed logging
- Green ‚úÖ means success
- Red ‚ùå means issues to investigate

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPO GO LIMITATION (IMPORTANT!)
**Expo Go doesn't support push notifications since SDK 53.** You'll see warnings like:
```
expo-notifications: Android Push notifications functionality was removed from Expo Go
```

**Solutions:**
1. **For Development**: Test on a **development build** instead of Expo Go
2. **For Production**: Use `expo build` or EAS Build for real push notifications
3. **Quick Test**: The debug panel will show ‚úÖ for most tests but use fake tokens

### No Notifications Received
1. **Check permissions**: Allow notifications in device settings
2. **Use physical device**: Simulators don't receive real push notifications
3. **Check network**: Ensure stable internet connection
4. **Check tokens**: Verify push tokens are saved in Firestore
5. **Build standalone app**: Expo Go can't receive real push notifications

### "No projectId found" Error
- **Fixed**: Updated notification service to use your Firebase project ID
- If you still see this error, check your `.env` file has:
  ```
  EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=hockey-accountability
  ```

### Notifications Not Clickable
- The notification tap handlers are set up in `App.js`
- Make sure you're testing on the same device that sent the message

### Development vs Production
- In development: Uses Expo Push Notification service
- For production: Would need Firebase Cloud Messaging setup

## Firebase Console Check:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
2. You can send test notifications from there
3. Use the push tokens from your Firestore users collection

## Remove Debug Panel:
Once testing is complete, remove these lines from `CoachDashboard.js`:
```javascript
import NotificationDebugPanel from '../components/NotificationDebugPanel';
// and 
<NotificationDebugPanel />
```

## Test Sequence:
1. ‚úÖ Run Quick Test from debug panel
2. ‚úÖ Send test message between coach and player  
3. ‚úÖ Verify notification appears on recipient device
4. ‚úÖ Tap notification to ensure app opens correctly
5. ‚úÖ Test mass messages to multiple players

## üöÄ For Real Push Notifications (Production):

Since Expo Go doesn't support push notifications, you'll need to create a **development build** or **standalone app**:

### Option 1: Development Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/cli@latest

# Login to Expo
npx expo login

# Create development build
npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:android
# or
npx expo run:ios
```

### Option 2: EAS Build
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile development

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

### Option 3: Test with Published App
When you publish your final app to app stores, push notifications will work normally.

Your push notification system should now work! The debug panel will help identify any remaining issues.
